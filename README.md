# Gamma-Renewal-Process
Renewal process is usually represented under Poisson distribution, in which the time between events follow an exponential distribution. The other famous distribution for renewal process is negative binomial. The former can only represent equidispersion, meaning equal mean and variance. The latter can also represent overdispersion, but underdispersion is still not explained by this model. To overcome this issue, Gamma renewal process can be used.
GammaRenewal.m should be compiled. It uses GamCliklhd.m as a function.
